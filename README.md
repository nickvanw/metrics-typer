# Metrics Transformer

A lightweight service that receives Prometheus remote_write metrics, transforms them by modifying metric types based on name patterns, and forwards them to another Prometheus-compatible endpoint.

## Features

- Receives metrics via Prometheus remote_write protocol
- Transforms metric types based on hardcoded name patterns
- Forwards transformed metrics to a configurable destination
- Minimal dependencies (only protobuf and snappy compression libraries)

## Metric Type Mapping

The service uses a hardcoded mapping of metric name patterns defined in `internal/config/config.go` and can be modified directly in the code.

## Configuration

Configuration is provided via environment variables:

- `LISTEN_ADDR`: Address to listen on (default: ":8080")
- `DESTINATION_URL`: URL to forward metrics to (required)

## Usage

```bash
# Run with default listen address
DESTINATION_URL="http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write" ./metrics-transformer

# Run with custom listen address
LISTEN_ADDR=":9090" DESTINATION_URL="http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write" ./metrics-transformer
```

## Building

```bash
# Generate protobuf code
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative internal/proto/remote.proto

# Build binary
go build -o metrics-transformer ./cmd/server
```

## Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t metrics-transformer .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config metrics-transformer
```
